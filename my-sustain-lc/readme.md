## Sustain-LC environment implementation

The environment interfaces with a high-fidelity Modelica model compiled as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) version 2.0 for Co-Simulation, leveraging the PyFMI library for interaction.

### FMU Integration and Simulation Core

The core of the simulation is a Modelica model representing the data center's liquid cooling thermodynamics. This model is compiled into an FMU, for example `LC_Frontier_5Cabinet_4_17_25.fmu`. The environment utilizes PyFMI to:

1.  Load the FMU and parse its model description.
2.  Instantiate the FMU for simulation.
3.  Set up the experiment parameters, including start time (0.0) and a tolerance (if specified, default is FMU's choice).
4.  Initialize the FMU into its starting state.
5.  During an episode step:
    *   Set input values (actions from the RL agent) to specified FMU variables.
    *   Advance the simulation time by `sim_time_step` using the `fmu.do_step()` method. This is repeated until the agent's `step_size` is covered.
    *   Get output values (observations for the RL agent and values for reward calculation) from specified FMU variables.
6.  Terminate and free the FMU instance upon closing the environment or resetting for a new episode.

The FMU variable names used for interfacing are explicitly defined within the environment:

*   **Action Variables:** `self.fmu_action_vars` (e.g., `pump1.speed_in`, `valve1.position_in`)
*   **Observation Variables:** `self.fmu_observation_vars` (e.g., `serverRack1.T_out`, `ambient.T`)
*   **Power Consumption Variables (for reward):** `self.fmu_power_vars` (e.g., `[pump1.P, fan1.P]`)
*   **Target Temperature Variable (for reward):** `self.fmu_target_temp_var` (e.g., `controller.T_setpoint`)

### State (Observation) Space

The observation space is defined as a continuous `gymnasium.spaces.Box` with specific lower and upper bounds. It comprises the following variables retrieved from the FMU:

*   `FrontierNode.AvgBladeGroupTemp`: Average temperature of a Blade Group in a cabinet (K).
*   `FrontierNode.AvgBladeGroupPower`: Average power input to each Blade Group in a cabinet (W).

The bounds for these observations are set to e.g., `273.15 K` and e.g., `373.15 K` for temperature measurements, and between e.g., `0.0 kW` and e.g., `400 kW`, for power input measurements.

For the Cooling Tower Markov Decision Process, we have a similar observation space:

*   `FrontierNode.CoolingTower.CellPower`: Average power consumption of each cell of the cooling tower (W).
*   `FrontierNode.CoolingTower.WaterLeavingTemp`: Average temperature of the water leaving each cooling tower (K).
*   `T_owb`: Outside air wetbulb temperature.

### Action Space

The action space is a hybrid of continuous `gymnasium.spaces.Box` and discrete `gymnasium.spaces.Discrete`, allowing the agent to control:

*   `FrontierNode.CDU.Pump.normalized_speed`: Scaled speed of the CDU pump (-1 to 1).
*   `FrontierNode.CDU.TempSetpoint`: Scaled Coolant supply temperature setpoint (-1 to 1).
*   `FrontierNode.CDU.AvgBladeGroupValve`: Scaled Valve opening to allow coolant to collect heat from the corresponding blade group (-1 to 1).
*   `FrontierNode.CoolingTower.WaterLvTSPT`: Discrete setting of cooling tower water leaving temperature setpoint delta.

These scaled values allow the neural network models used for the RL agents to learn properly and not saturate at the activation layers.

### Reward Function

The reward function guides the RL agent towards desired operational states. It is calculated at each step as:

$$R_{\text{blade}} = \sum_{i,j} T_{i,j}$$

which is the negative of the aggregate temperature of the blade groups

$$R_{\text{coolingtower}} = - \sum_{i,j} P_{i,j}$$

which is the negative of the total cooling tower power consumption at each time step Where:

*   `T_ij` is the temperature of the j<sup>th</sup> blade group of the i<sup>th</sup> cabinet ∀ j in 1...B and ∀ i in 1...C
*   `P_ij` is the power consumption of the j<sup>th</sup> cell of the i<sup>th</sup> cooling tower ∀ j in 1...m and ∀ i in 1...N

The goal is to minimize server temperatures below the target and minimize energy consumption.

### Episode Dynamics and Simulation Control

An episode runs for a maximum of `max_episode_duration`. The agent interacts with the environment at discrete time intervals defined by `step_size`. For each agent step, the FMU's `do_step()` method is called `step_size` / `sim_time_step` times. The `reset()` method terminates the current FMU instance, re-instantiates and re-initializes it, ensuring a consistent starting state for each new episode. Initial observations are drawn from the FMU after initialization.

## Advanced AutoCSM usage for model building

This section covers advanced topics like building custom models for sustain-lc. This requires the user to have the following repositories and software installations.

### Software Installation

Dymola and OpenModelica both provide a GUI and a command-line interface (CLI) for creating, compiling, running Modelica model simulations as well as exporting them to binaries called Functional Mockup Units (FMUs).

### Repository Installation

Users need to clone the following repositories to their working folder that can be accessed by either Dymola or the OpenModelica IDEs:

1.  **Modelica Buildings library:** `git clone https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings.git`

    The Modelica Buildings Library is a free, open-source library for modeling building energy and control systems, developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It provides comprehensive component models for HVAC systems, including heat exchangers, pumps, and valves essential for liquid cooling applications. The library enables dynamic simulation of thermal systems with fluid flow, heat transfer, and controls integration for performance analysis and optimization. Its modular architecture allows users to construct complex cooling systems by connecting components through standardized interfaces that preserve energy and mass balance. The library's extensive validation against measured data makes it suitable for accurately simulating liquid cooling systems in buildings and data centers.

2.  **TRANSFORM:** `git clone https://github.com/ORNL-Modelica/TRANSFORM-Library.git`

    The TRANSFORM (TRANsient Simulation Framework Of Reconfigurable Models) Library is an open-source Modelica toolkit developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for modeling complex thermal-hydraulic systems. It specializes in advanced energy systems with particular strength in liquid-cooled applications, including advanced reactor designs and heat transfer loops. The library provides detailed component models for heat exchangers, pumps, compressors, and specialized fluid systems with comprehensive thermophysical property implementations. TRANSFORM excels at simulating transient behaviors in cooling systems, making it valuable for studying system responses during operational changes or upset conditions. The modular architecture enables scaling from component-level to system-level simulations with various working fluids, including specialized coolants used in high-performance liquid cooling applications.

    </div>

3.  **datacenterCoolingModel:** `git clone https://code.ornl.gov/exadigit/datacenterCoolingModel.git`

    The Data Center Cooling Model is an ORNL-developed specialized simulation framework targeting liquid cooling systems specifically for high-performance computing facilities. The repository provides detailed modeling capabilities for direct-to-chip, immersion, and rear-door heat exchanger liquid cooling technologies increasingly adopted in modern data centers. Its component models account for the complex interactions between IT equipment heat generation, coolant flow distribution, and thermal management systems at rack, row, and facility scales. The framework enables performance assessment, optimization, and efficiency analysis of cooling systems under various operating conditions and workloads. The models support integration with power consumption data to enable comprehensive energy efficiency calculations and cooling infrastructure planning for data centers.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="assets/exadigit-logo.png" alt="exadigit" width="400"/>
    </div>

4.  **AutoCSM:** `git clone https://code.ornl.gov/exadigit/AutoCSM.git`

    ExaDigit AutoCSM is a template system-of-systems modeling approach for automating the development, deployment, and integration of Cooling System Models (CSMs) for supercomputing facilities within the ExaDigiT framework.

    ExaDigiT is a digital twin of supercomputers and their thermal infrastructures. It offers insights into operational strategies, “what-if" scenarios, as well as elucidates complex, cross-disciplinary transient behaviors. It also serves as a design tool for future system prototyping. It combines telemetry and simulations, providing a virtual representation of physical systems. It supports planning, construction, and operations, offering value in decision-making, predictive maintenance, and system efficiency. In design stages, it can evaluate energy efficiency, virtually prototype cooling systems, and model network performance. During operations, ExaDigiT aids in predictive maintenance and operational optimization.
    ExaDigiT is built on an open software stack (Modelica, SST Macro, Unreal Engine) with an aim to foster community-driven development, we have formed a partnership with national supercomputer centers (Oak Ridge National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Los Alamos National Labs (USA), PAWSEY (Australia), LUMI (Finland), CINES (France), CINECA (Italy), etc) around the world to develop an open framework for modeling supercomputers.
    AutoCSM is a Python-based framework to assist in CSM developers in accelerating the creation and deployment of system-level thermal-hydraulic CSMs. The intention is for this tool specifically to help standardize digital twin workflows for ExaDigiT. However, this tool can be used independently of ExaDigiT (and even other systems besides CSMs).

### Custom Sustain-LC models using AutoCSM

The primary model building process based on the specified structure is executed by the AutoCSM API library. It reads the JSON file and then populates a Modelica file using elements from the datacenterCoolingModel library.

To execute this process, we simply run the
`"python run_auto_csm.py"`
from the CLI in which the JSON file and the Python files are located in the AutoCSM library. The user needs to specify the path to the desired JSON file inside the `run_auto_csm.py` file as well as compilation parameters like solver information, steps to solve etc.

The above process generates the FMU which is then wrapped inside a Gymnasium Environment for Sustain-LC. Most of the common application requirements are already covered by the default Sustain-LC environment file `frontier_env.py`. If the user wishes to specify highly custom variables for logging, they have to specify those variables in the info dictionary for the environment.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="assets/autocsm_exadigit.png" alt="autocsm" width="400"/>
    </div>

Of these libraries, the user needs to access the **datacenterCoolingModel** to study the atomic structures of the thermodynamic components that can be used to build custom data center configurations. An example configuration is provided in Example JSON. This JSON describes an example hierarchical structure for the models. Further example hierarchical structures used for the results in the main paper are also included in the sustain-lc repository.
